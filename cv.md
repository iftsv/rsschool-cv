## Briefly About Myself
I was an experienced System Administrator with four years of experience in the Government organization. I have vast experience in administrating, management, and supporting activities associated with the IT infrastructure at a multi-user organization. Right now, I'm working as a Junior QA Engineer in a modern and fast-growing IT company. I have advanced problem-solving and collaboration skills.
I like to try something new, so that's why I decide to gain knowledge in the field of Front-End Development.
